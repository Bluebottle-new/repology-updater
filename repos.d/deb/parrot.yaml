# there's some ambiguity here on which is the correct repo for Parrot:
#
# [1] https://archive.parrotsec.org/parrot/dists/stable/{source}/source/Sources.gz
# [2] https://archive.parrotsec.org/parrot/dists/parrot/{source}/source/Sources.gz
# [3] https://deb.parrotsec.org/parrot/dists/stable/{source}/source/Sources.gz
# [4] https://deb.parrotsec.org/parrot/dists/parrot/{source}/source/Sources.gz
#
# Looking into Parrot ISO, [2] is used in apt/sources.list and [3] sources.list.d/parrot.list
# https://docs.parrotsec.org/doku.php/mirrors-list only says there should be [3] in sources.list.d/parrot.list
#
# Quick check shows all repos are the same. We're also using [3] here
#
# XXX: The above written is partly outdated, there's dists/lts vs. dists/parrot now
# which seem to be the same
