class RuleMatchStatistics:
    """Registry of Rule match frequency

    This class stores information in Rule match frequency, e.g. how
    many times a Rule was matched per total number of Packages
    processed. This information is used in optimized Ruleset lookups.

    This class also supports persist storage, so complete frequency
    info from a previous parse run may be reused for the next run.

    Note that we cannot reference Rules by number here, as numbers
    may change between parse runes, so Rules are instead referenced
    by their hashes.
